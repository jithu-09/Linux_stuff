User management
User management in Linux is a critical aspect of system administration, as it involves creating, modifying, 
and deleting user accounts, managing user permissions, and ensuring the security of the system. 

#90% of production system run on linux

Creating users and groups
- To create a new user, use the `useradd` command followed by the username. 
  For example, to create a user named "john", you would run:
  ```bash
  sudo useradd john
  ```
  #switch user: sudo su - john, switch back to root: exit
  #to check the user in use: whoami
  # to save user details, use: sudo adduser john -> creates a home directory as well.
  # to check user creation, access: sudo vim /etc/passwd

- To set a password for the new user, use the `passwd` command followed by the username.
  For example, to set a password for the user "john", you would run:
  ```bash
  sudo passwd john
  ```
  # to check passwd creation, access: sudo vim /etc/shadow
  ### can't decrypt the password(one way encryption) or restore the password. ###

- To create a new user with a home directory and set a password in one command, you can use:
  ```bash       
    sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash john
    sudo passwd john
    ```

- To create a new group, use the `groupadd` command followed by the group name.
  For example, to create a group named "developers", you would run:
  ```bash
  sudo groupadd developers
  ```
  # to check group creation, access: sudo vim /etc/group

- To add a user to a group, use the `usermod` command with the `-aG` option.    
  For example, to add the user "john" to the "developers" group, you would run:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG developers john
  ```   

- to delete user
  ```bash
  sudo userdel john
  ```
  # to delete user and home directory
  ```bash
  sudo userdel -r john
  ```
  # to delete group
  ```bash
  sudo groupdel developers #will only delete the group not the user
  ```
  # to delete group and all users in the group
  ```bash       
    sudo groupdel -r developers
    ```

#diff btw useradd and adduser
-useradd: low level command, creates a user account, no details, quick way, 
useful in scripts(no prompts will be shown)
-adduser: high level command, creates a user account, prompts for details, creates a home directory

#ssh(secure shell)
- SSH is a protocol used to securely connect to remote systems over a network.
- linux server has a process running sshd
- personal computer has ssh client, which installs ssh
- SSH uses public key cryptography to authenticate users and encrypt data.
- Popular choices for ssh client, windows: git bash, mac- terminal(iterm2-out of box)

one way to login:
ssh <username>@<ip address>
enter password

for this : modify vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/<file>.conf
set PasswordAuthentication yes

if this is no: then login through pem file
