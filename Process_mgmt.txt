Process management as a linux admin:
- view Processes
- Kill, stop, resume Processes
- prioritize Processes

view: 
-ps -ef, doesn't show the memory utilization
-ps aux(shows mem util), to get line number => ps aux | nl
-to get word count => pa aux | wc -l

kill a Process:
- first ps aux | grep <processname> then do kill <PID>( forcefully delete: kill -9 <PID>)
- to filter out the query line(i.e the first cmd used to search the process)
  . ps aux | grep <processname> | grep -v grep
  . kill -3 <PID> : get thread dumps of a process(especially java processes)
  . kill -STOP <PID>: to stop a process, kill -CONT <PID> to continue the stopped process 

Set priority for a process:
- renice -n 10 -p <PID> : less priority if number is positive
- renice -n -5 -p <PID> : more priority if number is negative
# cpu assumes the process that runs for a longer time in it should be given more priority

Services: special kind of processes, run in background, come up automatically during boot time of server
- systemctl list-units --type=service: to list all services
- systemctl status <service>: to check the status of a service
- systemctl start/stop <service>: to start/stop a service
