# cpu: nproc, htop  
  memory: htop, free -h  
  disk:df -h, du -sh   
  network

# general flow:
linux server -> connected to prometheus(scraps data through nodeexporter or other endpoint, stored in timeseries db) -> alertmanager(scraps data from prometheus) -> sends alerts to slack or email
-> sends data to grafana -> can create dashboards to visualize the data

top: real time monitoring, cpu and mem util as well
- ps aux is not real time, it is a snapshot of the processes at that time
- htop: interactive process viewer, more user friendly than top

vmstat: virtual memory statistics, shows the memory utilization of the system, tells about free memory

iostat: input/output statistics, shows the disk utilization of the system

top cant be used in script, rather use free -m: m for megabytes
free -h: human readable format

nproc: number of processors

df -h: disk free space
du -sh <dir>: disk usage of a directory, <dir> not mandatory
  just du -sh: shows the disk usage of the current directory
